    <!-- this is going to be a slideshow.  each slide will be a different project.  each one will be an image representative of the project.  i want a hover effect that displays a transparent overlay that provides: project title, date published, client name.  then the user should be able to select that image/slide and view a bigger view of the specific project.

  if this isn't the slideshow, then this will be an array...a data page (this would end up being a .js file then.) this would be like the blog project in that i could store all my projects and their pieces of info here, then add items to it and add projects to the array that then directly feed into the constructor.    -->
